				She's as quaint as the morning breeze of autumn
				Her cheeks are as delicate as spring's blossom

				Her smile is as mellow as the evening rays of sun

				Her hair smells like earth after rain
				Her embrace is like mother's but with less pain

				Her eyes are like amber sky,gloomy yet sharp
				Her arms are like fragile willow tree's branch

				Her soul is like glass,strong yet delicate
				Her voice sounds like canary ,soft and elegant

				Her tears are like summer rain,merry yet needy
				My lonely heart could be nothing but greedy.</b>

			<h2>Tormentation Of A Dream</h2>

			<h3>- July 06, 2022</h3>
			<b>
				I was watching Tv when I saw a documentary about World War II,a soldier was burnt alive in the middle of
				the street and was melted there by his fellow soldiers during holocaust because he wanted to go home,he
				wanted to avoid the war,he wanted to avoid the cruelty,So after seeing that post i wrote this thinking
				about him and many other who were just like him,who were tortured to death just because they wanted
				peace.
				Dreadfully he stayed

				Delicately he thought

				Delightfully he dreamt

				Dangerously he fought



				Excited he was

				Endeavour he felt

				Ecstatic it seemed

				Endorsed he held



				Foster he was

				Furiously it ended

				Fought in else's war

				Fumed he melted



				Guilty they were sure

				Glad he was gone

				Grappled they were too

				Gloomily came the dawn



				Holocaust it was

				Higher was the flood

				Had his heart for dinner

				Held a glass full of blood

			<h2>An Estranged Stranger</h2>
			<p>
			<h3>- September 08, 2022</h3>
			<b>I don't know,if it's you who's changed or if it's me who's deranged but we surely are more than
				estranged.

				The same lips that used to talk about love are now swifted by grodiness.
				Those eyes once saw my sanity but now all they see is my subdudeness.

				Those ears used to hear my heartbeat but now all they hear is stillness.

				Those hand used to touch my spirit but now all they feel is numbness.



				Maybe it's not our fault,maybe it's time who scared us to our depths and plunged us into the void of
				wretched darkness.</b>

			<h2>Schizophrenia And Dream</h2>

			<h3>- May 05, 2023</h3>

			<b>Hey,I miss you, No,not in a way that I want you here or I want to be there; I just miss you. I miss you
				when
				the world gets too heavy,when my head gets too light, when walking in the street, if a random stranger
				touches my hand I miss you,because once you were also a stranger to me. If missing you was a game,I
				would
				always stay at the top of the table.

				It was only after you that I realized that missing someone doesn't have to always be sad. I miss you in
				a
				happy way. I miss your small talk. I miss seeing myself in your eyes. I miss the way you used to look at
				me
				in awe. I miss the way our hearts used to beat in sync.

				You know what's funny? Sometimes I hear your voice ringing in my ears like the most harmonious melody
				I've
				ever heard. I used to see you;now I dream about you. I used to listen to you;now I talk to you. I used
				to
				read to you;now I write about you. I wish I could write the way that I thought about you,but I don't
				know
				those big words like you did.You should've taught me when you were here.

				Anyway,I want you to know that I quit smoking,and about drinking,I sometimes take a pint or two just to
				remember your face because I'm starting to forget how you used to look. I still remember your scent
				though;
				you used to smell like summer's breeze,like earth after rain,like spring's bloom. Now everything around
				me
				seems and smells eerie,like a burning forest or autumn's dead leaves in a burning forest.

				Gotta go (he stands up from the sandy beach sore). Oh, I almost forgot,I love you, and yeah, I don't
				hate
				the moon anymore. Actually, you know what? The moon has become my second favorite thing in the night
				sky;
				obviously,my first will always be you.If you were here you will find this cliche,but this is the only
				way I
				can talk to you,oh wait,no(He wakes up).</b>

			<h2>I Was 18,Living A Delusion</h2>

			<h3>- November 22, 2022</h3>
			<b>
				I miss my old self when I was with you

				When everything was golden and was blue

				I miss your tears but not your eyes

				I miss your words but not your lies

				I miss your smile but not your mouth

				I knew it was gloomy but you were endowed

				I miss your withered lips on my forehead

				Only if I knew all of it was about to shred

				Were you real I used to wonder

				Turned out it was all my blunder

				I was sure you were everything but an illusion Sadly,It was all in my head as a mere delusion</b>

			<h2>At 19 It Became Real</h2>

			<h3>- November 29, 2022</h3>
			<b>
				I miss my old self when I was with you

				When Everything was fine and was blue

				When I was happy and you were too

				When Life was easy but we never knew

				Now all that left is memories of you



				I don't miss you,I just miss your presence

				I miss your kiss but I don't miss your lips

				I miss holding hands but I don't miss your hand



				I just miss the sensation not your hug

				I miss your smile but not your mouth

				I miss your voice but not your sound

				And you deftly said”we were to bound”



				Sadly I miss your tears but not your eyes

				You gave me nothing but mere lies</b>
