			<h1>Transientness Of Dead Butterflies</h1>
			<p>
			<h3>- May 05, 2023</h3>

			<b>The butterflies in my stomach have died, and now their rotting corpse is eating me up inside to the point
				where they've reached my heart and torn down the door that kept it safe. They've broken the barricades
				and
				reached each and every chamber of my heart. As the rotting butterflies continue their feast, I can feel
				them
				crawling further up inside my heart. Their Tiny legs scratch and claw at my insides, leaving a trail of
				destruction in their wake. It's like they're on a mission to reach the very core of my being.They are
				flowing inside my veins, reaching and breaching each and every part of the body. They are vigorous,
				thriving
				in there, devouring me up inside, reaching the point where all that's left is my hollow bones and my
				lonely,
				desolate soul.

				You know how the butterflies are beautiful and angelic when they're alive, but when they're dead and
				inside
				of you, their remains seem to morph into something else entirely, a dark and malevolent force that
				taints
				your very being with its demonic essence. It's like they're performing a ritual of death inside of you.

				At last, the butterflies in my stomach have devoured me completely and taken flight, leaving behind
				nothing
				but the echoes of their wings and the remnants of their feast. The once vibrant colors of their wings
				are
				now stained with the darkness of my demise, and the only evidence of their existence left behind is the
				empty husk of what used to be me. As they soar away into the sky, I am left to decay, consumed by the
				very
				thing that once brought me joy and excitement. I'm withering here as a hollow shell of who I used to
				be.</b>

			<h2>The Reconciling Dream</h2>
			<p>
			<h3>- April 06, 2023</h3>
			<b>
				Today, I saw you in my dreams more like your silhouette. You were standing at my front door,You had
				cut your hair like you always wanted to and you were taller than me,funny right?Your wish finally
				came true. Your figure was there, but your features were blurred, and your essence was elusive.I was
				just about to approach you then I woke up.

				I know right?,I wanted to talk to you too.Wanted to catch up.

				I used to watch you in awe like a colorful creation in my heart's store.I used to reach you like the
				rouge waves hitting on sandy ocean shore.I know your heart stopped beating a long time ago but still
				with each breath I take, I am filled with your essence, your laughter, your warmth, and the way your
				heart beats in perfect sync with mine.

				Yes,You heard me right,I still remember how your heart used to sound.



				"Cliche?Oh you haven't changed a bit,have you?"

				Anyway,you were always there,a constant in my life,filling my days with laughter and nights with
				pride,but now you feel like a distant memory, a faint echo of a time long gone.



				"Enough?what do you mean enough?I have so much catching up to do."

				You know I could've traveled the world and seen all its wonders, but I would've still thought about
				you with each passing breeze.Right?



				"Why did you slit your wrist open?What kinda question is that?"

				I wanted to be with you dumbass,I couldn't take it anymore,after not being able to meet you in my
				dreams so I came here.Your laughter, your eyes, your face all appeal to me, I know for sure your
				voice, your radiance, your speech All thrill me, I'm certain, and more,
				my life can't survive without you my love can't exist without you,
				that's true,you're not just my friend, nor my lover you're the only meaning of my life,
				forever.</b>-

			<h2>Graveyard Of Fates: Where Destiny Is Buried</h2>

			<h3>- March 22, 2022</h3>

			<b>
				Graveyard, a place where people are buried, a place where dreams come to an end, a place where bodies
				rest but souls wonder,will there be peace or chaos rules there too?. Will there be silence, if yes, then
				will it be too loud? I want to know how it feels to be just 6 feet under but infinity away from this
				cruel world,but can we feel anything when we are trapped inside our own body and covered in earth ?Come
				to think of it destiny might be graveyard's best friend, wasn't it destiny that took the life of a 7
				years old in a car crash? But can we blame destiny for the death of his 88 year old Grandpa in the
				hospital that the boy was visiting?The graveyard is not just full of boxes and bones but dreams too. The
				boy wanted to be an astronaut and the old man dreamt about his Grandson's 8th birthday. So who's
				responsible for crushing their dream?Was it the truck driver that crashed directly into the car and
				killed the boy only or the nurse who was too busy on her phone while on duty? maybe none, maybe it was
				their destiny after all that took them to rest next to each other at the old cemetery..</b>

			<h2>Flight Of Death</h2>

			<h3>- May 11, 2022</h3>
			<b>
				Embarking on a journey destined to an early end
				A lonely bird flew far away from his inn

				To find his lost fate he flew
				In rain and in snow with hazy hue

				He flew around blues and sierras too
				To get to a place he never knew

				The rove was hard but he made it through
				Time and again he recalled home too

				But the destiny had said otherwise
				His fate came to an end one night

				An errie August night it was
				He came to know about all the ills he has

				Did he flew straight into a river bourn?
				And was it everyone or only August Mourn?</b>

			<h2>Plight Of Death</h2>

			<h3>- May 15, 20222</h3>
			<b>
				Gazing at the night sky he sat alone
				Dazzling dim dots reminded him home

				The home that shattered into pieces
				The home that was nabbed by leashes

				The home that is near yet so far
				The home that is at peace and at war

				The home once had a family of plenty
				That same home is now uncannily empty

				"Will I ever go back"He wondered
				Little did he know his dreams were plundered

				A soft gush came and took him at his best
				Forlorn was the thought "Where may I rest?"
